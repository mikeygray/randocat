# Randocat

A random personal project to deliver random cat pictures to a webpage. Possibly
an excuse to refresh my [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) capabilities. Hosted at
[cats.mikeygray.co.uk](http://cats.mikeygray.co.uk/) but not securely because
[Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.co.uk/) want more money for subdomian certs.

## Setup

The usual:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeygray/cats.git
cd cats
yarn install
yarn start
```
